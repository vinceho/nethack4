This is a mostly unsorted and vague list of changes which will probably eventually be in AceHack.

If you have ideas of your own, add them to the [Ideas]() page.

- default DEC/IBM/Unicode graphics
- stash tracking
- some way to save notes with the character
- unequip one item to equip another
- uniqueness in trap colors
- cursed armor should autoBCU when worn
- ID kicking boots when they make things reel
- travel position should reset between levels
- new statuses need to cause a botl update
- applying keys should not ask so many questions
- travel should route past peacefuls more sensibly
- traps need a valid glyph in IBM rogue graphics
- lit middot vs. unlit lowdot; a consequence of darkroom vs. rogue? (it went away when I changed to IBM and back to DEC, so probably)
- option to stop autoexplore with unexplored objects in LOS
- show prices of items in containers
- wipe out engravings from the engrave menu
- price memory in \

- some way to mark squares on a level by hand
- extra question upon #loot/a,
- track down nooodl's double-branch thing
- livelog
- Windows support (far in the future)
- use targethighlight to show range on jumps/pounds (even with the option off?)
- allow E and . over h in the engrave menu (different people think this should be on different keys...)
- list wishes in ^Xc (and thus dumplog)
- fix wresting somehow
- fix m-move into shopkeepers/trices (I consider this a vanilla bug, the devteam probably don't)
- do something about autopickup picking up the player's stash
- warn on self-zaps of known dangerous wands
- ID base types of wished-for items
- farlooking doors in tutorial mode should trigger the talk about doors
- tutorial shouldn't recommend force bolt to valks if they find a random book of it
- show turncounts in ^P

- shift-move should be saner (especially wrt boulders)
- control-move should also be saner (especially wrt diagonal corridors)
