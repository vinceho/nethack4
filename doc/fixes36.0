Changes in AceHack 3.6.0. Emacs, this is a -*- text -*- file.

This is a list of changes between NetHack 3.4.3 and AceHack 3.6.0.
These are in no particular order, and every change is listed, even
though some are likely much bigger than others.

General Fixes
-------------

Reading a cursed scroll of destroy armor no longer gives permanent
increases to abilities while wearing cursed gauntlets of dexterity or
a cursed helm of brilliance.

It's no longer possible to wrest a wand in one turn via levitation.

Item lists are now sorted into alphabetical order; this avoids an
exploit whereby the player could determine the identity of an item
from the order it appeared in a bones file.  (Patch credits: Jeroen
Demeyer and Jukka Lahtinen, via Debian.)

The "Itemized billing?" prompt now supports 'q' as an option.

All items in a character's starting inventory are now marked as
prerecognised.  (It's assumed that characters got the chance to take
them into the dungeon well in advance, rather than finding out just as
they entered.)

Modified Features
-----------------

Scoring has been completely redone; players are now scored in a number
of categories, with huge diminishing returns in each category.  Thus,
it's better to do well in a range of things than very well in one;
hopefully, this will put a stop to score being meaningless (or worse,
a low score being considered more impressive than a high one).

The AI for pets has been improved, meaning that intelligent pets are
now capable of actually using many of their attacks.  (Patch credits:
?)

Most of the options in the game have been removed or hidden; they
still exist if anyone really wants to change them, but most of them
have been set to sane defaults and then made undocumented.

runmode, timed_delay, and sparkle are now one combined option,
"animation".  If you have a fast computer, it's likely that the only
setting for it that actually shows visible animation is "full"; the
other settings are provided for slower machines.

The control-X feature now shows a lot more information, including
things like the player's intrinsics; none of the information there is
anything that a spoilt player couldn't work out from their own message
history, but actually doing so was often a pain.

It's now possible to read spellbooks of spells you know quite well
already; doing so refreshes your knowledge, but wears out the
spellbook just as much as rememorising a spell or refreshing an almost
forgotten spell.

The entrances to all branches and the dlvl 1 upstairs are now ladders,
rather than stairs; additionally, stairs in the Mines have become
ladders.  This is both for flavour, and to help the player distinguish
normal stairs from branch entrances.

The Vibrating Square is now visible from a distance; it will always be
marked if it's ever been in the player's LOS and is not covered by a
monster or object, due to it now giving off a visible glow.

The game's command system has been rewritten, making commands
customizable.  The major breaking changes are: "repeat command" is now
on # rather than n or digits (extended commands are /still/ on #, but
no clash is possible); and by default, digits have their numpad
meaning, and letters have their vikeys meaning (so even if you use the
numpad to move, you'll need to use ^D or #kick to kick).  All commands
are now available as extended commands; and likewise, all
(non-wizmode) commands but "enter explore mode" are now available as
non-extended commands, either by adding new commands or generalising
old ones.  (A specific list of what has changed command-wise is given
in the "Change Detail" section at the end.)

Many monsters have changed colour (ghosts and shades have even changed
sym, to W) in order to make it easier for the player to tell them
apart; underlining is used as well as colour for this purpose. (See
the "Change Detail" section at the end for details.)

Jumping boots now give a message when worn or removed (in nearly every
case in vanilla NetHack, you can check /anyway/ without even spending
a turn), which causes them to self-ID.  Likewise, all characters
recognise potions of oil for the same reason. (Credits: suggestion for
auto-IDing jumping boots by casmith789.)

Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes
-----------------------------------------

(tty interface)
The botl has been cleaned up significantly, leaving a lot more room to
show things like statuses.  It also now shows semi-graphical Hp and Pw
bars that change colour according to how wounded or exhausted you are.


General New Features
--------------------

A new tutorial mode provides hints on the game and its controls as
it's played.

Platform- and/or Interface-Specific New Features
------------------------------------------------

(autoconf system)
The standard build system is now autoconf-based.  (Patch credits:
initially from Slash'EM; ported from UnNetHack)

Change Detail
-------------

Command changes:

1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,y,u,h,j,k,l,b,n: Numbers now have numpad meanings by
default, letters now have vikeys meanings by default. So either the
numbpad or the letter keys can be used to move.

C, #name: These commands have been merged, and display a menu to ask
what to do. (Credits: nethack.alt.org for the idea, although the code
is mine.)
^E: Now a synonym for #enhance.
^I: Now a synonym for #adjust.
M: Now a synonym for #monster.
^V: New command, to review tutorial slides.
Q: No longer prints a message about #quit.
S: Now allows the user to quit, in addition to continuing to play.
(The key sequence S!y to quit is chosen to be almost impossible to
press by mistake, in order to hopefully prevent accidents; I had
trouble typing it in order to write this changelog!)
T, R: These commands have been merged; either will allow armor or
accessories to be removed, with R now being deprecated.
W, P: These commands have been merged; either will allow armor or
accessories to be worn, with P now being deprecated.
X: Now a synonym for #twoweapon. (Credits: Another nethack.alt.org
idea.) The old meaning of X, "enter explore mode", was moved to
#xplore.
#: Now used to repeat commands (like the old numpad n), in addition to
its use for entering extended commands.

The following commands still have their old meanings, or are mapped to
a new command that encompasses their old meanings, but are now
deprecated in favour of other alternatives:
p (use c), P (use W), R (use T), * (use A).
(Credits for the idea of merging W/P and R/T go to dtsund.)
