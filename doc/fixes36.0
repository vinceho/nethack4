Changes in AceHack 3.6.0.  Emacs, this is a -*- text -*- file.

This is a list of changes between NetHack 3.4.3 and AceHack 3.6.0.
These are in no particular order, and every change is listed, even
though some are likely much bigger than others.

General Fixes
-------------

Reading a cursed scroll of destroy armor no longer gives permanent
increases to abilities while wearing cursed gauntlets of dexterity or
a cursed helm of brilliance.

It's no longer possible to wrest a wand in one turn via levitation.
(Patch credits: Brent Dalager <bcd@pvv.org>)

Item lists are now sorted into alphabetical order; this avoids an
exploit whereby the player could determine the identity of an item
from the order it appeared in a bones file.  (Patch credits: Jeroen
Demeyer and Jukka Lahtinen, via Debian.)

The "Itemized billing?" prompt now supports 'q' as an option.

All items in a character's starting inventory are now marked as
prerecognised.  (It's assumed that characters got the chance to take
them into the dungeon well in advance, rather than finding out just as
they entered.)

High Priests on the Astral Plane no longer give away their identity
when Called something else.

Candles can now be added to a candelabrum while underwater.  (Patch
credits: Sgeo via the NetHack patchdb)

Bisecting a long worm with 1hp no longer crashes the game.  (Patch
credits: bhaak via the NetHack patchdb)

The game no longer crashes if a thrown potion breaks on iron bars and
would otherwise have hit a monster.  (Patch credits: bhaak via
UnNetHack.)

The game no longer crashes when a wielded item is applied to the face,
autotransforms, or burns out.  (Patch credits: bhaak via UnNetHack.)

The game no longer crashes when acid falls into a pool or moat.
(Patch credits: bhaak via UnNetHack.)

Some typographical and grammatical errors were fixed.  (Patch credits:
bhaak via UnNetHack for some fixes, others are original to AceHack.)

Some actions now take 1 action rather than 0: manipulating a
drawbridge with music, kicking at nothing.  (Patch credits: bhaak via
UnNetHack.)

The game no longer crashes when trying to travel on a level with a
very large number of boulders or with certain highly unusual
placements of closed doors.

Modified Features
-----------------

Scoring has been completely redone; players are now scored in a number
of categories, with huge diminishing returns in each category.  Thus,
it's better to do well in a range of things than very well in one;
hopefully, this will put a stop to score being meaningless (or worse,
a low score being considered more impressive than a high one).

The AI for pets has been improved, meaning that intelligent pets are
now capable of actually using many of their attacks.  (Patch credits:
code by Grunt)

Most of the options in the game have been removed or hidden; they
still exist if anyone really wants to change them, but most of them
have been set to sane defaults and then made undocumented.  Even some
of the ones that still exist have changed defaults (e.g. color to
true, autopickup [and exceptions to it] to a sane set of settings).

runmode, timed_delay, and sparkle are now one combined option,
"animation".  If you have a fast computer, it's likely that the only
setting for it that actually shows visible animation is "full"; the
other settings are provided for slower machines.

The control-X feature now shows a lot more information, including
things like the player's intrinsics; none of the information there is
anything that a spoilt player couldn't work out from their own message
history, but actually doing so was often a pain.

It's now possible to read spellbooks of spells you know quite well
already; doing so refreshes your knowledge, but wears out the
spellbook just as much as rememorising a spell or refreshing an almost
forgotten spell.

The entrances to all branches and the dlvl 1 upstairs are now ladders,
rather than stairs; additionally, stairs in the Mines have become
ladders.  This is both for flavour, and to help the player distinguish
normal stairs from branch entrances.

The Vibrating Square is now visible from a distance; it will always be
marked if it's ever been in the player's LOS and is not covered by a
monster or object, due to it now giving off a visible glow.

The game's command system has been rewritten, making commands
customizable.  The major breaking changes are: "repeat command" is now
on # rather than n or digits (extended commands are /still/ on #, but
no clash is possible); and by default, digits have their numpad
meaning, and letters have their vikeys meaning (so even if you use the
numpad to move, you'll need to use ^D or #kick to kick).  All commands
are now available as extended commands; and likewise, all
(non-wizmode) commands but "enter explore mode" are now available as
non-extended commands, either by adding new commands or generalising
old ones.  (A specific list of what has changed command-wise is given
in the "Change Detail" section at the end.)

Many monsters have changed colour (ghosts and shades have even changed
sym, to W) in order to make it easier for the player to tell them
apart; underlining is used as well as colour for this purpose.  (See
the "Change Detail" section at the end for details.)

Jumping boots now give a message when worn or removed (in nearly every
case in vanilla NetHack, you can check /anyway/ without even spending
a turn), which causes them to self-ID.  Likewise, all characters
recognise potions of oil for the same reason.  (Credits: suggestion
for auto-IDing jumping boots by casmith789.)

The gaze of a floating eye now forces players to miss, rather than
paralyzing them.  (Floating eyes still have their paralysis defence in
all other contexts.)

Instead of automatically confirming attacks on peaceful monsters,
Stormbringer now acts as a ring of aggravate monster while wielded (in
addition to its other effects).

Amnesia's effect has been changed.  It now no longer causes the player
to forget the map or seen traps; instead, it affects a much larger
proportion of objects.  Forgotten objects are now /called/ by their
actual name; so forgetting what a potion of blindness does, for
instance, would lead to "potion called potion of blindness" rather
than "potion of blindness" in the inventory.

Travel now handles traps more sensibly: it will go slightly out of its
way to avoid walking through a trap, but if it's necessary to go
through a trap, it will travel to just before the trap and then stop,
allowing the player to choose to walk through it or continue.
(Credits: Suggestion for the change by nht.)

It's no longer possible to fail to choose a direction for a spell;
NetHack 3.4.3 just repeats the last direction (perhaps killing the
player arbitrarily), AceHack 3.6.0 will keep prompting until a
direction is given.

While not stunned, confused, levitating, flying, or in a monster form
that can move along the ceiling, attempting to move into known water
or lava now requires an 'm' prefix (or whatever it's set to in your
options), in order to prevent players falling into water or lava by
mistake.  (Credits: suggestion by casmith789.)

Attempting to walk into a door is now equivalent to trying to open it
(say with the 'o' command).  (This even works for an unknown door;
just leaning on a door is enough to open it, unless it gets stuck or
resists.)  (Credits: idea taken from UnNetHack, but with different
code.)

Walking into shopkeepers now attempts to pay them, if you owe them
anything; walking into other always-peaceful monsters (or shopkeepers
who you owe no money) chats to them.  (Sometimes-peaceful monsters
still give the "do you want to attack?" prompt.)  In order to attack
such monsters, use the 'F' command.

The #enhance/^E screen now shows how many skill slots you have left,
and how many it costs you to enhance various skills.

The message "You climb up the ladder." no longer appears when climbing
ladders (mostly because ladders are a lot more prevalent in AceHack
than in NetHack).

Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes
-----------------------------------------

(tty interface)
The botl has been cleaned up significantly, leaving a lot more room to
show things like statuses.  It also now shows semi-graphical Hp and Pw
bars that change colour according to how wounded or exhausted you are.
Statuses are now coloured according to severity, and many more things
are shown as statuses than were before (e.g. levitation, greasy hands,
poisoned).  (Credits: Thanks to Squolly for suggesting the expansion
of statuses.)

There is a new character creation screen, that allows you to view a
character's stats and inventory before you start playing, and to
choose a different one if you don't like it.  (This breaks
"startscumless" conduct just by existing; if you want to prove that
you won with the first character that the RNG produced, say as part of
a streak, turn off the new "startscum" option and the stats and
inventory will be hidden unless you choose to look at them.)

New centralised routines are used for drawing things to the screen;
although potentially slightly less efficient than the old ones,
they make it much easier to extend the drawing code to do new sorts of
drawing.  They also now set both the foreground and background colors
explicitly if the color option is turned on; this should avoid the
problem where graphics can't be seen properly due to unusual terminal
settings such as a white background.

The game now highlights possible directions to, e.g., fire things in,
by using a red background.  (Credits: this was kerio's idea.)
Background colors are also used to signify other things, e.g. detected
monsters, pets, peaceful monsters.  (Credits: This idea was inspired
by Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.)

Squares which contain known traps are colored cyan no matter what is
actually on the square, to warn the player against stumbling into
them.

The default character used to represent traps is now ^ rather than ".

(tty interface on all platforms but DOS, OS/2, WIN32)
IBMgraphics now sends signals to the terminal telling it to select a
suitable character set for drawing that graphics; hopefully, this will
make IBMgraphics "just work" rather than requiring crazy character set
fixes.  The control codes \001 and \004 are no longer used on the
Rogue level on these platforms either, preventing many terminals
breaking upon encountering it.

(UNIX-like systems, either directly or via autoconf)
The default number of players allowed to play at once on a UNIX system
is now unlimited, rather than 4.  (The restriction is a pretty
meaningless one anyway, as it can be avoided merely by running NetHack
directly rather than via the script that normally runs it.)

General New Features
--------------------

A new tutorial mode provides hints on the game and its controls as
it's played.

The menucolors patch has been added, allowing customisable colouring
of menus based on regular expressions.  (Patch credits: Pasi Kallinnen
via UnNethack.)  AceHack-specific additions include a default set of
colours for items depending on the item's behavior: see "Change
Detail" for more information.

Every area of the game now has coloured walls and floor.  The exact
colours depend on which branch you're in, whether you've stepped on
the square before, and whether it's lit; dark areas of a room are now
shown coloured rather than as blank space (unless color is turned
off).  (Patch credits: based on the darkroom patch by Clive Crous, via
UnNetHack.)

A new conduct "startscumless" counts the number of times you looked at
a character's stats before choosing to play with it.

Objects in shops now have visible price tags, that are shown when you
step on them.  (Patch credits: a marginally modified version of a
patch by bhaak for UnNetHack.)

New commands ^O (or #overview) and ^F (or #annotate) show a summary of
features you've seen on levels you've visited, and allow you to name
the current dungeon level with a name that shows up in ^O,
respectively.  (Patch credits: Hojita Discordia, via UnNetHack.)

Platform- and/or Interface-Specific New Features
------------------------------------------------

(autoconf system)
The standard build system is now autoconf-based.  (Patch credits:
initially from Slash'EM; ported from UnNetHack)

(tty interface)
Monsters now have their background color changed to show various
aspects of the monster (blue=tame, brown=peaceful, magenta=detected).

When using directional commands (t, m, etc), the possible directions
to aim in are highlighted.

Change Detail
-------------

Default menucolors for items (with some examples):
known cursed: orange
unidentified: cyan
enchantment+erosion negative: red
attack (e.g. weapons/attack wands/books of attack spells): green
item/dungeon-affecting (e.g. digging, enchanting, polymorph): brown
creation (e.g. create monster, bag of tricks, wishing): cyan
intrinsics/extrinsics (e.g. invisibility, gain strength): light blue
debuffing enemies (e.g. sleep, taming, conflict): blue
divination (e.g. lamp, identify, crystal ball): white
healing (e.g. unihorn, potion of gain energy): yellow
movement (e.g. teleport, levitation, jumping): light green
harmful items (e.g. sickness, blindness, fumbling): magenta
mundane items (e.g. food ration, blank paper, fruit juice): gray
unique items (e.g. bell of opening, amulet of yendor): light magenta

Command changes:

1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,y,u,h,j,k,l,b,n: Numbers now have numpad meanings by
default, letters now have vikeys meanings by default.  So either the
numbpad or the letter keys can be used to move.

c, #chat: c now means #chat (the old meaning of c, "close door", has
been moved to o).  These commands can now be used to pay your bill in
a shop (which takes precedence over ordinary chatting).
C, #name: These commands have been merged, and display a menu to ask
what to do.  (Credits: nethack.alt.org for the idea, although the code
is mine.)
^E: Now a synonym for #enhance.
^I: Now a synonym for #adjust.
M: Now a synonym for #monster.
^V: New command, to review tutorial slides.
Q: No longer prints a message about #quit.
s: No longer wakes mimics (instead, upon detecting a mimic, an
unseen-monster I glyph is placed on the square to mark its location)
S: Now allows the user to quit, in addition to continuing to play.
(The key sequence S!y to quit is chosen to be almost impossible to
press by mistake, in order to hopefully prevent accidents; I had
trouble typing it in order to write this changelog!)
T, R: These commands have been merged; either will allow armor or
accessories to be removed, with R now being deprecated.
V: A new command that merges #rub, #invoke, and wand-breaking.  (The
old V was moved to #versionhistory.)
W, P: These commands have been merged; either will allow armor or
accessories to be worn, with P now being deprecated.
X: Now a synonym for #twoweapon.  (Credits: Another nethack.alt.org
idea.)  The old meaning of X, "enter explore mode", was moved to
#xplore.
^X: Now shows ability scores (as they're no longer on the botl), both
current and "natural" (i.e. without the effects of items or poison).
Also lists information shown at game end, like inventory and conducts,
although it does not identify your possessions for you; likewise, it
will show your intrinsics, but not your extrinsics.
#: Now used to repeat commands (like the old numpad n), in addition to
its use for entering extended commands.

The following commands still have their old meanings, or are mapped to
a new command that encompasses their old meanings, but are now
deprecated in favour of other alternatives:
p (use c), P (use W), R (use T), * (use A).

(Credits for the idea of merging W/P and R/T go to dtsund.)

The following commands were deleted: !v)[="(
v is now available as #versionshort (and V as #versionhistory);
something similar to ! should likely be provided by your operating
system (you can also use ^Z on systems that support it); and the
remaining equipment commands are all special cases of A.
