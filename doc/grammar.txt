NetHack 4 now uses a special grammar-tagging format internally for
messages, and they are subsequently translated into messages in
natural language.

The basic tokens are words (English is always used internally, but
it should theoretically be possible to translate to other languages):
N{goblin}        A noun (always written in the singular)
N{125|goblin}    A noun, with a uniquifier (to show /which/ goblin)
N{f,125|goblin}  A noun, with a gender and uniquifier
N{i,light}       An indefinite noun (uses "a" not "the")
                 (note: uniquified non-proper nouns are automatically made
                 indefinite on the first use, and definite thereafter)
P{Izchak}        A personal name (but N{Amulet of Yendor})
P{12|Dudley}     A player, with a uniquifier to show which player
V{run}           A verb (present plural, regardless of how it's used)
A{tame}          An adjective
D{slowly}        An adverb
Q{as}            A relative pronoun not being used as a noun
S{Ouch!}         An entire sentence (usually used for interjections)
E{above}         A preposition that isn't being used with a verb
?{}              An unknown noun (used as a noun)
C{}              A clause (always made out of a combination of words)

In addition, anything that's entered by the user (rather than being part of the
game source) is surrounded by \x1c, in order to "escape" it to avoid injection
of weird bits of grammar, and in order to be able to handle attempts to get
unique deaths via fruitnames.

Absolute pronouns, articles, and conjunctions never appear in the message at
all; rather, it's the grammar parser's responsibility to add them. (It'll
typically add "the" to non-indefinite nouns, use "and" to combine clauses but
"but" if the second is a negated clause, and use uniquifiers to determine
whether a repeated noun deserves to be made into a pronoun.)  Things like idioms
and compound verbs are best written out inside a grammar marker (e.g.
"D{happily every after}"), otherwise they'll be nearly impossible to translate.
Prepositions are /always part of the verb/ if they aren't being implied in via
pseudo-adverbs; this is because the use of prepositions varies so much from
language to language, and it allows appropriate ones to be substituted. (The
exception is if they aren't being attached to a verb, in which case they're much
more stable.)

Also, anything but a sentence can be negated, and any two things with the same
grammatical class except sentences can be combined:
N{-,N{weapon}}           "nonweapon"
A{+,A{black},A{blue}}    "black and blue"

And other combinations work like this:

NV, PV                             Verb with subject
C{V{die},P{12|Dudley}}
"You die", "Dudley dies", depending on who the message is sent to

s,V                                Verb used in the passive
C{s,V{V{kill},N{143|newt}}}
"The newt is killed"

VN                                 Verb with object
V{V{hit},P{12|Dudley}}
"hits you", "hits Dudley"

VA                                 Verb with complement
V{V{are},A{cursed}}
"is cursed"

VD                                 Verb with adverb
V{V{open},D{slowly}}
"slowly opens"

VV                                 Verb with secondary verb
V{V{can},V{open}}
"can open the door"

(In English, secondary verbs are either chained with the primary, as in "can
open" or "must want"; or infinitivized and chained, as in "want to
go". Secondary verbs can also be chained with each other ("You must want to go
there"). We solve this with a dictionary lookup, and so all verbs used in the
game with secondaries are listed here:

Primary verbs whose secondary is chained directly in English:
can, had better, should, may

Primary verbs whose secondary is chained via an infinitive in English:
are, begin, want, choose, strain, have, fail, wait for, try, pick

"do" and "have" used as grammatical entities in English have their own rules,
but don't appear in the trees. Also, chained-directly primaries tend to be
negated with "verb not", and all others with "do not verb", apart from "are" for
some reason; "you are not hard to kill", not "you do not be hard to kill" which
is definitely parseable for an English speaker but sounds ridiculous.)

There is also a tense modifier i, on a clause to indicate that the verb should
be sent into imperfect past tense, or p, for perfect past tense, or c, for
continuous perfect tense:
C{P{12|Dudley},V{wake up}}         "You wake up", "Dudley wakes up"
C{i,P{12|Dudley},V{wake up}}       "You woke up", "Dudley woke up"
C{p,P{12|Dudley},V{wake up}}       "You have woken up", "Dudley has woken up"
C{c,P{12|Dudley},V{wake up}}       "You are waking up", "Dudley is waking up"
Because of the number of irregular verbs in English, all verbs which are used
with this that don't form their imperfect with -d (ending in -e) or -ed
(otherwise), their continuous with "is -ing", and their perfect with "have "
before their imperfect, are listed here:
are, have, read

NA, PA                             Noun with adjective
N{N{potion},A{orange}}
"orange potion"

NEN                                Noun relative to another noun
N{N{body},E{on},N{altar}}
"body on the altar"

n,N, n,P *,n *,P                   Noun with quantity
N{2,N{123|dagger}}           N{*,N{rune}}
"2 daggers", "two daggers"   "runes"

f,N,A, f,N,N                       Noun with fractional quantity
N{f,N{*,N{dagger}},A{2}}                       N{f,N{cake},N{slice}}
"2 of the daggers", "two of the daggers"       "slice of cake"

s,f,N,A                            Noun with unit quanitity
N{s,f,N{*,N{dagger}},A{1}}
"one of the daggers"

o,N,N, o,N,P                       Noun with owner
N{o,N{dungeon},P{12|Dudley}}
"Your dungeon", "Dudley's dungeon"

l,N,N                              Noun with limitation
N{l,N{information},N{dungeoneering}}
"information about dungeoneering"
Choosing between "about" and "of" is problematic. So far, this is used with:
of: knowledge, imitation
about:

m,anything                         Mention a sentence fragment
N{m,N{lightning}} or A{m,N{lightning}}
""lightning""

c,A                                Comparative of adjective
A{c,A{hot}}
"hotter"

s,A                                Superlative of adjective
A{s,A{hot}}
"hottest"

Some adjectives form comparatives/superlatives with -er/-est, and some with
more/most. Here's the ones that are used:
-er/-est with normal stem rules: keen
-er/-est doubling final consonant:
more/most: confident, skilled, experienced


AD                                 Adjective with adverb
A{A{hot},D{very}}
"very hot"

DD                                 Adverb with adverb
D{D{slowly},D{excruciatingly}}
"excruciatingly slowly"

t,N                                Item used to perform something
D{t,N{i,hammer}}
"with a hammer"
English also allows a contraction if this is used on a participle:
C{s,p,V{V{damage},?{},D{t,N{water}}}}
"it is damaged with water", "it is damaged by water", or "it is water-damaged"
The first case is a little unnatural, and the second is probably hard to
automate without a dictionary of special cases, so let's use the third :)

l,N, a,N                           Location where something happens
D{l,N{door}}     D{a,P{Gehennom}}
A{l,N{door}}     A{a,P{Gehennom}}
"at the door"    "in Gehennom"
l, is used for point locations; a, for areas.

d,N                                Duration for which something happens
D{d,N{i,hour}}
"for an hour"

m,N                                Time at which something happens
D{m,N{midnight}}
A{m,N{midnight}}
"at midnight"

e,N                                End state of an action
D{e,N{i,despair}}
"to despair"

i,N                                Indirect object
D{i,N{*,N{god}}}
"to the gods"

p,A                                Parenthesized adjective
A{p,A{hot}}
"(hot)"

AV                                 Adjective with verb
A{A{hard},V{manage}}
"hard to manage"

NV                                 Noun with verb
N{N{will},V{live}}
"will to live"

V                                  Generally affected by the verb in question
A{V{curse}}     A{V{V{paint},N{red}}}
"cursed"        "painted red"

N                                  Generally limited by the noun in question
N{N{corpse},A{N{gnome}}}
"gnome corpse"

QC                                 A comparison clause
D{Q{while},C{V{sleep},P{12|Dudley}}}
"while you sleep", "while Dudley sleeps"
A{Q{where},C{V{sleep},N{dragon}}}
"where the dragon sleeps"
Comparison clauses can usually go either at the start of the sentence or the end
in English. NetHack usually puts them at the start; it's more dramatic that
way. When being used as adjectives rather than adverbs, they go just after the
noun they're modifying in English, rather than just before like most adjectives.

a,NV                               A noun that is verbing
N{a,N{1|newt},V{V{hit},P{12|Dudley}}}
"The newt hitting you", "The newt hitting Dudley"

NN                                 A noun limited by a noun
N{N{corpse},N{gnome}}
"gnome corpse"

q,NN                               A magical item name (X of Y)
N{N{*,N{boot}},N{speed}}
"boots of speed"

q,C                                Create a question rather than a sentence
C{q,C{V{hit},N{1|newt},P{12|Dudley}}}
"Does the newt hit you"
This is done by either substituting in "do" as the verb and putting that first,
or moving the verb first (unless there's a relative pronoun in the subject
position, in which case nothing needs to be done; so many special cases in
English...). The verb is moved first if it's in the following list:
are
Also, the first relative pronoun used as a noun moves to the start of the
sentence:
where

(i.e. "Where do you want to cast the spell?", not "Do you want to cast the spell
where?" (the second is arguably correct English but sounds absurd); but "What do
you want to do when?", not "What when do you want to do?", or "Do you want to do
what when?"; and "Who wants to cast the spell?", not "Does who want to cast the
spell?", or "Who does want to cast the spell?")

i,V                                Create an imperative
C{i,V{V{kill},N{1|newt}}}
"Kill the newt"


Forming a complete sentence is simply done by putting the punctuation
after a clause, or by using a complete sentence:

C{V{die},P{12|Dudley}}...               "You die..."
S{Ouch!}                                "Ouch!"

Other parts of speech can be used too; this is mostly used for things like menu
headings. The only change from use inside a clause is that they'll be
init-capsed, rather than the clause.
